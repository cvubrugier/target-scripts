target-scripts
==============

This repository used to contain target-export-device, a simple shell
script to export a block device or file as an iSCSI target.

The target-export-device script has been moved to the Linux kernel
documentation under [Documentation/target/](http://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/latest/source/Documentation/target/target-export-device).
